### **Here is our quickstart guide.**
* Clone the repo
```shell
 git clone git@github.com:AlexKimani/upesi.git
```
* When you attempt to clone the repository, you receive the error message. [Fix â€“ git@github.com : permission denied](https://dev.classmethod.jp/articles/fix-gitgithub-com-permission-denied-publickey-fatal-could-not-read-from-remote-repository/)
* [Install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Ensure that docker is always running.

## Running and testing
* via IDE for local debugging (recommended)
  * Run all the required Services on Docker `docker-compose up --scale service-upesi-auth=0 service-upesi-account=0`. Note: This command won't start `service-upesi-auth` and `service-upesi-account`
  Please follow the troubleshooting section if you are facing any issue
  * Start app via IDE (SpringBoot: `com.upesi.upesiauthserver.UpesiAuthServerApplication` or `com.upesi.upesiaccount.UpesiAccountApplication`). [Not Recommended]
* Build and Test
  * `./mvnw clean build`
  * Integration tests will use test containers
* Run
  * via Docker
    * `docker-compose build service-upesi-auth` and `docker-compose build service-upesi-account`

### Coverage

Coverage is implemented using jacoco. To generate the coverage report locally run

```
cd account-management && mvnw test jacocoTestReport
```

### Coverage Verification

```
cd upesi-auth-server && mvnw test jacocoTestReport jacocoTestCoverageVerification
```
